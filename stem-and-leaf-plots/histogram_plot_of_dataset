# Some charities operate very efficiently, with fundraising and administrative expenses that are only a small
# percentage of total expenses, whereas others spend a high percentage of what they
# take in on such activities. Here is data on fundraising expenses as a percentage of
# total expenditures for a random sample of 60 charities. 
# This problem shows what is called a stem-and-leaf display as well as a histogram.
